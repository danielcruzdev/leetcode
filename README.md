# LeetCode Challenges in C#

Welcome to my repository for LeetCode challenges solved using C#! Here, you'll find my solutions to various algorithmic problems from LeetCode, implemented in C#.

## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. It features a vast collection of algorithm problems, ranging from easy to hard, covering various topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, and more.

## Structure

Each problem solution is organized into its own folder, named after the problem's title or identification number. Within each folder, you'll typically find:

- **Solution file(s)**: C# code files (Program.cs) containing the solution implementation.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute your own solutions or improvements, feel free to open a pull request! Contributions are always welcome and appreciated.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my own work and are provided for educational purposes. While they are thoroughly tested and optimized to the best of my ability, there may still be room for improvement.
